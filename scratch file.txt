Show your friends on your profile page.
these friends will link to the home page but will filter down the posts to only posts by that friend.

maybe add a way to filter posts to only users that are friends with the currently logged in user?

add the "add friend" button to the post and not the home page.
Would there be a way to make it aware of whether or not the user is already friends with that person?

while updating stuff, maybe add all the users post links to their profile page in a "posts" section.
